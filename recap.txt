Reason for halt:

    could not implement appropriate loss functions such as dtw or emd custom loss classes

Things to be implemented:

    - a layer that converts displacement-stroke data to be used
    inside custom loss classes just like normalisation layer

    - dataloader to manage normalisations to regenerate values for comparision and usage
